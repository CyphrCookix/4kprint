# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current website has a solid foundation for image handling with basic lazy loading and WebP support detection. However, there are significant opportunities to optimize image performance, loading strategies, and user experience. This optimization will focus on implementing advanced image handling techniques including modern formats, responsive images, progressive loading, and enhanced caching strategies to improve Core Web Vitals and overall user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want images to load quickly and efficiently, so that I can browse the portfolio and content without delays or layout shifts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits any page THEN images SHALL load with minimal impact on page performance metrics
2. WHEN images are loading THEN the system SHALL prevent layout shifts and provide visual feedback
3. WHEN a user has a slow connection THEN images SHALL load progressively with appropriate fallbacks
4. WHEN images fail to load THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error states and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile user with limited bandwidth, I want to receive appropriately sized images for my device, so that I don't waste data on unnecessarily large images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the site on different devices THEN the system SHALL serve images optimized for their screen size and resolution
2. WHEN a user has a high-DPI display THEN the system SHALL serve higher resolution images when appropriate
3. WHEN bandwidth is limited THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical images and defer non-critical ones
4. WHEN modern image formats are supported THEN the system SHALL serve AVIF/WebP instead of JPEG/PNG

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want the portfolio images to showcase our work effectively while loading quickly, so that potential customers have a great browsing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the portfolio section THEN images SHALL load with smooth transitions and proper aspect ratios
2. WHEN a user opens the lightbox THEN high-resolution images SHALL load efficiently with loading indicators
3. WHEN portfolio images are displayed THEN they SHALL maintain quality while being optimized for web delivery
4. WHEN users browse multiple portfolio items THEN the system SHALL preload likely next images intelligently

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust image optimization system that handles various formats and scenarios, so that the website maintains excellent performance across all conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing image optimization THEN the system SHALL support multiple modern image formats (AVIF, WebP, JPEG, PNG)
2. WHEN images are processed THEN the system SHALL generate multiple sizes for responsive delivery
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL have comprehensive fallback mechanisms and error handling
4. WHEN new images are added THEN the system SHALL automatically optimize them according to established patterns

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want images to be properly described and handled, so that I can understand the content regardless of whether images load successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are displayed THEN they SHALL have meaningful alt text and proper ARIA attributes
2. WHEN images fail to load THEN alternative content SHALL be provided that conveys the same information
3. WHEN using screen readers THEN image loading states SHALL be announced appropriately
4. WHEN images are decorative THEN they SHALL be properly marked to avoid screen reader confusion
